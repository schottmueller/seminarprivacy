2. read the survey: Acquisti, Alessandro, Curtis Taylor, and Liad Wagman. "The economics of privacy." Journal of Economic Literature 54.2 (2016): 442-492.
3. read your paper, search for related literature and read it
4. submit commitment paper (including a non-binding idea for 5)
5. produce a small but original contribution, for example: 
  - a variation of the model (simplify to extend)
  - a numerical solution/simulation that illustrates aspects of the model in the paper which have not been or can not be showed analytically
  - a worked-out numerical example where you can illustrate the results of the paper (leading to a graphical illustration)
  - a comparison of the results in the paper to later, related papers (if this is not made in those later papers)


** What are you expected to do? II

1. write up what you have learned (following the structure in the course description)
2. prepare a presentation
3. send paper (and presentation) to the discussant
4. read the paper you have to discuss and prepare a discussion
5. skim other students' papers before presentation day
6. presentation and discussion
7. improve and polish your paper based on the feedback you got and submit

** Important dates and formal requirements
- deadline for commitment paper: October 1, 9.00

* How to write your seminar paper?
** How to write your seminar paper? structure
- structure from syllabus:

  - Introduction: Explain what is the topic and why it is interesting for economists.

  - Related Literature Review: Briefly explain which other articles are relevant for the issue at hand and put the paper in a broader context.

  - Model: Present the setup of the paper.

  - Results: Present and discuss the results of the paper. Avoid repeating proofs, but make sure you understand them and give intuitions, illustrations, or summaries of the main arguments instead.

  - Your Contribution: see slide 3
  - Related Work: Briefly summarize related papers which appeared after the one you have been assigned (can be merged with the “related literature review”)

  - Conclusion: Summarize your work and its message; possibly point out open questions.

** How to write your seminar paper? style

- academic style 
  - no personal value judgements or expressions of personal preferences (avoid words like "very", "good", "bad", "easy" etc.)
  - make quotes recognizable (plagiarism!)
- general rules of style apply 
   - check some English style guide

- bibliography and citations author (year) style
   - Author (year); Author1 and Author2 (year); Author1 et al. (year)
   - bibliography at the end of the paper:
      - Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. /American Economic Review 71 (2)/, 405–409.
      - Solove, D. J. (2010). /Understanding Privacy./ Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

- notation: mnemonic, as simple as possible
- a paper is not a crime novel (no suspense, climax etc.)
- make it easy to read (don't over-complicate)

** How to write a seminar paper? practical issues
- consider using LaTeX 
   - use the [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX][wikibook]]
   - BibTeX for citations, see Osborne's [[https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM][guide]]
   - LaTeX template on Absalon
- if you don't want to write LaTeX directly, consider LyX
- literature search
   - access to papers mainly via [[https://www.jstor.org/][JSTOR]] and [[http://www.sciencedirect.com][sciencedirect]] (use VPN if you are off campus)
      - pre-formatted bibliography entries, including BibTeX format
   - Google scholar 
      - pre-formatted bibliography entries, including BibTeX format
      - search using arbitrary terms; e.g. title, author, keywords
      - "cited by" to find follow up papers

* How to present your paper
** How to present your paper
- you can use slides (consider the LaTeX Beamer package...directly or through LyX)
- what is the starting point? (your chosen published paper)
   - what is the problem/question?
   - why is it relevant?
   
- what is your original contribution?
   - motivation: why is it relevant?
   - what did you do?
   - what are the results/implications?
   - what is critical?
- conclude
   - what is your message (in less than 3 sentences)?

* How to discuss a paper?
** How to discuss a paper?
- what is the main (new) point of the paper from your point of view? 
- is the original contribution clear and convincing? (what are the crucial assumptions and do they make sense? is there a relevant application?)
- is the representation of the published paper/literature accurate?
- your constructive comments, e.g.
  - point out a new application or applicability to a related problem
  - suggest a -- not mentioned -- relation to literature 
  - can the results/analysis be viewed from a different perspective? how does the analysis fit into the big picture?

- if you find a (mathematical) error, tell the author immediately; i.e. before presentation day.

- do not publicly comment on style, language, grammar and spelling, or notation; (you are encouraged to do this in private)
